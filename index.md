# Sanjay Rangavajjhala

## About Me

Dedicated professional with a proven track record in conducting thorough research in computational biology. Experienced in leveraging Python for biological data processing and analysis. Skilled in presenting complex findings to stakeholders. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biological and Medical Informatics at UCSF, focusing on bioinformatics in the context of precision medicine.

## Education

### University of California San Francisco | Started Aug 2024
* Ph.D. in Biological and Medical Informatics

### University of California Berkeley | May 2024
* B.A. in Molecular & Cellular Biology, Emphasis in Immunology & Molecular Medicine
* B.A. in Computer Science
* Minor in Data Science

## Research Experience

### GlaxoSmithKline plc | May 2023 - August 2023 | Generative AI/ML Intern | Philadelphia, PA
* Enhanced vaccine production efficiency using Generative Adversarial Networks and Foundational Models to generate synthetic training data.
* Outlined strategy to implement AI as chief data generation method across all GSK manufacturing.
* Familiarity with Azure DevOps services, Pytorch, and associated libraries, and DallE-2/Project Florence.

### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | March 2021 - August 2023 | Research Assistant | Berkeley, CA
* Conducted full genome analysis and visualization of the evolutionary history of NLR genes in Soy, Maize, and Arabidopsis, including investigating the mechanism of high variability.
* Led the development of a script that would allow analysis of immune proteins without access to full pan-genome. | [NLRCladeFinder](#projects)
* Co-authored paper published in Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions with mentor Daniil Prigozhin.

### Institute for Systems Biology | May 2019 - August 2019 | Research Intern | Seattle, WA
* Led parameter optimization on electronic health record vectorization for high dimensional analysis to find population disease trends.
* Evaluated potential for vectorization to be used as a standard for work on electronic health records and large genome repertoires like the 1000 Genomes Project.
* Co-authored paper published in Human Genetic and Genomic Advances with mentor Gwênlyn Glusman.

## Projects

### NLRCladeFinder | Python
* Created open-source tool to accept any NLR sequence from Maize, Soy, or Arabidopsis and return evolutionary context, clade alignment, phylogenetic tree, and sequence diversity information.
* Used BioConda, ToyTrree, Matplot, and Chimera libraries.
* Included in the publication “Majority of the highly variable NLRs in maize share genomic location and contain additional target-binding domains.”

### Artificial Intelligence-Powered PacMan | Python
* Used Naive Bayes and Hidden Markov Models to power a PacMan agent against adversarial Ghost agents.
* Created heuristic values to inform inferences of ghost positions and optimal paths for PacMan agent.
* Familiarity with the Scikit-learn package.

### COVID Rate Predictive Model | Python
* Developed a time series model to map COVID severity based on voting patterns in the US at county granularity using US Census data.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis using Pandas and GeoPandas.
* Constructed a logarithmic model predicting voting status based on COVID positivity, income, and mask usage.

### Secure File Sharing System | Golang
* Built a file-sharing system with invitation scheme and access revocation using Golang.
* Utilized RSA and symmetric encryption.
* Implemented constant-time AppendToFile operations.

### Database Storing Scheme | Java
* Developed a functional database storing scheme with B+ tree storing.
* Implemented concurrency and recovery measures.

### American Voting Legacy Datathon | Python
* Quantified voter disenfranchisement due to the Electoral College.
* Used GeoPandas for data visualization.
* Won third place in the Berkeley Datathon for Social Good.
